Hello user. You can now evaluate and test my test task!

1.In this task, I had to implement subscription to user cards with saving data when they change...
2.There is also a filter for sorting cards by subscriptions and their absence
3.All this is implemented with the help of React Route, which allows you to easily travel through the pages

You can leave shortcomings, bugs or advice in the comments to the repository
